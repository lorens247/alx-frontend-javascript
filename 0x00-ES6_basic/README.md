# ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)

## New Features Introduced in ES6

1. **let and const Declarations:**
   - `let` allows the creation of block-scoped variables.
   - `const` creates constants whose values cannot be reassigned.

2. **Arrow Functions:**
   - A concise syntax for writing function expressions, often used for anonymous functions.
   - Provides a lexical `this`, avoiding the need for `bind()` in certain scenarios.

3. **Rest and Spread Operators:**
   - **Rest Operator (...):** Gathers the remaining arguments into an array.
   - **Spread Operator (...):** Spreads the elements of an array or object into individual elements.

4. **Default Parameters:**
   - Allows function parameters to have default values if no value or `undefined` is provided.

5. **Template Literals:**
   - Provides a convenient syntax for embedding expressions inside string literals.

6. **Destructuring Assignment:**
   - Enables extracting values from arrays or objects and assigning them to variables in a concise way.

7. **Classes:**
   - Introduces class syntax for creating objects, providing a more straightforward and concise alternative to prototype-based inheritance.

8. **Promises:**
   - Represents a value which might be available now, or in the future, or never, resolving the "callback hell" issue.

9. **Iterators and for-of Loop:**
   - Iterators enable custom iteration behaviors for objects, and the `for-of` loop simplifies iteration over iterable objects.

10. **Modules:**
    - Introduces a standardized way to organize code using `import` and `export` statements.

## Difference Between a Constant and a Variable

- A variable (`let`) can be reassigned, while a constant (`const`) cannot be reassigned once it has been given a value.

## Block-Scoped Variables

- Variables declared with `let` and `const` are block-scoped, meaning their scope is limited to the block (enclosed by curly braces) in which they are defined.

## Arrow Functions and Default Function Parameters

- Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions.
- Default parameters allow you to specify default values for function parameters.

## Rest and Spread Function Parameters

- The rest parameter (`...`) in function parameters allows you to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.
- The spread operator (`...`) can spread the elements of an array or object into individual elements.

## String Templating in ES6

- String templates use backticks (\`) and allow embedding expressions inside `${}` within the string.

## Object Creation and Properties in ES6

- Object literals provide a concise syntax for creating objects.
- Destructuring assignment simplifies extracting values from objects.

## Iterators and for-of Loops

- Iterators provide a way to iterate over data structures.
- The `for-of` loop simplifies iterating over iterable objects.
